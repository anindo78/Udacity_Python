# Write Python code that stores the distance 
# in meters that light travels in one 
# nanosecond in the variable, nanodistance. 

# These variables are defined for you:

speed_of_light = 299800000. # meters per second
nano_per_sec = 1000000000. # 1 billion

# After your code,running
# print nanodistance
# should output 0.2998

# Note that nanodistance must be a decimal number.

# ASSIGN nanodistance BELOW this line

nanodistance = speed_of_light * 1.0 / nano_per_sec
print nanodistance
